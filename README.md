## Disclaimer : 

*This addon aims to bring back a **template system for easier learning and presetting in Animation Nodes**, but its deep purpose is to **gather the AN Community** to build a clean and nice **Community NodeTree Library**.*

*If you feel creative, or you have some small utility NodeTree to show, **please do**, share it with the rest of the community and **make this Library huge, great, and really community-driven** !*

***How awesome would it be to have hundreds of carefully crafted NodeTrees anywhere you go, just one click away ?***
