## Disclaimer : 
This addon aims to bring back a **template system for easier learning and presetting in Animation Nodes**, but its deep purpose is to **gather the AN Community** to build a clean and nice **Community NodeTree Library**. 

If you feel creative, or you have some small utility NodeTree to show, please do, share it with the rest of the community and make this Library huge, great, and really community-driven ! 

How awesome would it be to have hundreds of carefully crafted NodeTrees anywhere you go, just one click away ?

Tonton.
