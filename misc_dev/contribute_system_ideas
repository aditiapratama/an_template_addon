hiding password
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/157938/hiding-a-password-in-a-python-script-insecure-obfuscation-only
Here is a simple method:

    Create a python module - let's call it peekaboo.py.
    In peekaboo.py, include both the password and any code needing that password
    Create a compiled version - peekaboo.pyc - by importing this module (via python commandline, etc...).
    Now, delete peekaboo.py.
    You can now happily import peekaboo relying only on peekaboo.pyc. Since peekaboo.pyc is byte compiled it is not readable to the casual user.

This should be a bit more secure than base64 decoding - although it is vulnerable to a py_to_pyc decompiler.
